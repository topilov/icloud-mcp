# iCloud MCP Server

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for iCloud. Gives Claude (Desktop, Code, claude.ai connectors) and any other MCP client full access to an iCloud account:

- **Calendar** (CalDAV): list/search/create/update/delete events, recurring events (RRULE), alerts (VALARM), IANA timezones, all-day events, iTIP invitations and cancellations by email.
- **Contacts** (CardDAV): list/search/get/create/update/delete, including notes; labels (home/work/custom) survive updates.
- **Mail** (IMAP/SMTP): folders, listing, server-side search, full messages with attachments, attachment download, sending (HTML, attachments, threaded replies), drafts, move/delete/read flags.

Runs in two modes with the same code:

| Mode | Transport | Typical use | Credentials |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Local ("offline")** | stdio | Claude Desktop / Claude Code launch it as a subprocess on your machine | `.env` or environment variables |
| **Server** | Streamable HTTP, stateless | Docker / Cloud Run / any host, many users | Per-request headers or HTTP Basic auth, env fallback |

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `calendar_list_calendars` | Calendars with IDs; Reminders lists are flagged `read_only` |
| `calendar_list_events` | Events in a date range, recurring series expanded per occurrence, sorted by start |
| `calendar_search_events` | Text search over summary/description/location |
| `calendar_create_event` | Create an event: timezone, all-day, `rrule`, `reminders` (minutes before start or `"09:00"` time of day), attendees (invitations sent by email) |
| `calendar_update_event` | Partial update; change timezone/recurrence/alerts; re-sends invitations when attendees change |
| `calendar_delete_event` | Delete and email cancellations to attendees |
| `contacts_list` / `contacts_search` / `contacts_get` | Read contacts (name, phones, emails, addresses, organization, title, notes) |
| `contacts_create` / `contacts_update` / `contacts_delete` | Write contacts |
| `email_list_folders` | Folders with IMAP flags |
| `email_list_messages` | Newest messages of a folder with readable `body_text`, `unread`, `has_attachments` |
| `email_search` | Server-side IMAP search: `query`, `sender`, `recipient`, `subject`, `body`, `since`, `before`, `unread_only` (AND) |
| `email_get_message` / `email_get_messages` | Full message(s): headers, `body_text`, optional raw `body_html`, attachment list |
| `email_get_attachment` | Download an attachment: save to a local directory (stdio) or return it inline |
| `email_send` | Send mail: multiple recipients, CC/BCC, HTML with auto plain-text alternative, local file attachments, threaded reply (`reply_to_message_id`); copy stored in Sent |
| `email_save_draft` | Same inputs as `email_send` but stores the message in Drafts for the user to review and send from any mail client |
| `email_move` / `email_delete` | Move between folders; delete to Trash (`Deleted Messages`) or permanently |
| `email_mark_read` / `email_mark_unread` | Toggle `\Seen` |

Every tool carries MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`) so clients can ask for confirmation before writes. Errors are returned as MCP tool errors with actionable messages (e.g. wrong password vs. missing credentials).

### Behaviour worth knowing

- **IDs**: calendar/contact/event IDs are full URLs, pass them back verbatim. Email IDs are IMAP UIDs and are only valid inside the folder they came from.
- **Times**: pass `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` plus an IANA `timezone` (default: `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`, which falls back to the machine's zone, then UTC) or `YYYY-MM-DD` for all-day events. Returned times are ISO 8601 with offset.
- **Recurring events**: `calendar_list_events` returns one entry per occurrence; update/delete apply to the whole series.
- **Email bodies** are converted from HTML to readable text and truncated to `EMAIL_BODY_MAX_CHARS` (20 000) so newsletters do not flood the model context. `full_html=true` returns the raw HTML too.
- **Attachments on disk** (`save_dir`, `attachment_paths`) are enabled by default in stdio mode and disabled in HTTP mode. Override with `ICLOUD_MCP_LOCAL_FILES` and restrict to a folder with `ICLOUD_MCP_LOCAL_FILES_ROOT`.
- **Rich text** that users paste into event notes/locations or contact notes comes back from iCloud as HTML; it is converted to Markdown so links and lists survive (`ICLOUD_HTML_MODE=markdown`, default), rendered to plain text (`text`) or passed through (`raw`).
- **Tool groups** can be switched off per instance with `ICLOUD_ENABLED_CATEGORIES=calendar,contacts,email` (e.g. a read-only mail agent gets `email` only).
- **Only iCloud hosts** are ever contacted with the account's credentials: calendar, event and contact URLs on any other host are rejected, and mail headers are validated against injection.
- **Outbound recipients** can be restricted with `EMAIL_SEND_ALLOWLIST=@mycompany.com,partner@example.com`; it applies to `email_send`, `email_save_draft` and calendar invitations, so a prompt-injected agent cannot mail data to arbitrary addresses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (tested on 3.12 and 3.14) or Docker
- An iCloud account and an **app-specific password**: <https://account.apple.com/account/manage> → Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords. iCloud Mail additionally needs an active `@icloud.com` / `@me.com` / `@mac.com` address.

## Local mode (Claude Desktop / Claude Code)

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mike-tih/icloud-mcp.git
cd icloud-mcp
uv venv && uv pip install -e .        # or: python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env                  # add ICLOUD_EMAIL / ICLOUD_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD
```

Try it:

```bash
.venv/bin/icloud-mcp --help
```

### 2. Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add icloud -- /absolute/path/to/icloud-mcp/.venv/bin/icloud-mcp
```

or, without a checkout at all:

```bash
claude mcp add icloud -e ICLOUD_EMAIL=you@icloud.com -e ICLOUD_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx \
  -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/mike-tih/icloud-mcp icloud-mcp
```

### 3. Claude Desktop

Config file: macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, Windows `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "icloud": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/icloud-mcp/.venv/bin/icloud-mcp",
      "env": {
        "ICLOUD_EMAIL": "you@icloud.com",
        "ICLOUD_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
        "DEFAULT_TIMEZONE": "Europe/Berlin"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`python /absolute/path/to/icloud-mcp/run.py` works as the command too. Restart Claude Desktop completely after editing the file; the server shows up under the tools icon.

## Server mode (Streamable HTTP)

```bash
icloud-mcp --http                      # 0.0.0.0:8000/mcp, stateless
icloud-mcp --http --port 9000 --path /icloud --stateful
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d                   # requires MCP_AUTH_TOKEN in .env; fallback mailbox credentials optional
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

The image runs `icloud-mcp --http` with `PORT` from the environment, so it works unchanged on Cloud Run, Fly.io, Railway etc. The server is **stateless**: every request carries its own credentials, no sessions are kept, and instances can be scaled horizontally.

### Authentication (per request)

Checked in order:

1. Headers `X-Apple-Email` and `X-Apple-App-Specific-Password`
2. `Authorization: Basic base64(email:app-specific-password)`
3. Environment `ICLOUD_EMAIL` / `ICLOUD_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` (single-user deployments)

### Protecting the endpoint

Set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` to a long random secret. **HTTP startup fails without it**, even when per-request mailbox credentials are used or `ICLOUD_MCP_ALLOW_ENV_CREDENTIALS=true` is set. Every MCP request must carry the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-MCP-Token: <token>` (`/health` stays open). Set `ICLOUD_MCP_ALLOW_ENV_CREDENTIALS=false` to disable environment credential fallback. `docker-compose.yml` publishes the port on `127.0.0.1` only; use a TLS reverse proxy for remote access. Run HTTP through the supported `icloud-mcp --http` entrypoint so this policy is installed.

```bash
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) icloud-mcp --http
claude mcp add --transport http icloud https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "X-Apple-Email: you@icloud.com" -H "X-Apple-App-Specific-Password: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

Example with Claude Code against a remote server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http icloud https://mcp.example.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "X-Apple-Email: you@icloud.com" -H "X-Apple-App-Specific-Password: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

Always put the server behind HTTPS: app-specific passwords travel in headers.

### Restricted tool surface

The default `ICLOUD_ENABLED_TOOLS=safe-mail` exposes only `email_list_folders`,
`email_list_messages`, `email_search`, `email_get_message`, `email_get_messages`,
`email_get_attachment`, `email_send`, and `email_save_draft`. Delete, move,
read-state changes, calendar tools, and contacts tools are not registered.
This default applies to both HTTP and stdio; it changes the previous full-access default.

Set a comma-separated list of exact tool names for a smaller or custom surface,
or explicitly set `ICLOUD_ENABLED_TOOLS=all` to restore the full tool set.
The tool allowlist intersects `ICLOUD_ENABLED_CATEGORIES`; unknown tool names fail
startup. Use `EMAIL_SEND_ALLOWLIST` to restrict recipients of mail, drafts, and
calendar invitations/cancellations. An empty recipient allowlist allows any
recipient, so sending still requires appropriate authorization from the caller.
Docker Compose forwards both allowlists and keeps local attachment files disabled.

Mail deletion defaults to moving messages to Trash. Repeating this in Trash is
refused unless `permanent=true` is explicitly requested. Permanent deletion and
COPY-based moves require UIDPLUS; there is no mailbox-wide EXPUNGE fallback.
CardDAV endpoints and discovered hrefs must use trusted HTTPS hosts; redirects
are rejected rather than following them with mailbox credentials.

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables (a `.env` file next to the checkout is loaded). See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list. The important ones:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ICLOUD_EMAIL`, `ICLOUD_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | – | Fallback credentials |
| `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` | machine zone or `UTC` | Timezone for naive event times; set explicitly on servers |
| `EMAIL_BODY_MAX_CHARS` | `20000` | Body truncation |
| `EMAIL_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` | `20971520` | Outgoing attachment budget |
| `EMAIL_SEND_ALLOWLIST` | – | Allowed outbound addresses/domains (send, drafts, invitations) |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_LOCAL_FILES` | stdio: on, HTTP: always off | Allow attachment-file reads/writes in stdio only |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_LOCAL_FILES_ROOT` | – | Confine those files to a directory |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | – | Required for HTTP startup and every MCP request |
| `ICLOUD_MCP_ALLOW_ENV_CREDENTIALS` | true with token | Serve the env account over authenticated HTTP; cannot bypass token auth |
| `ICLOUD_ENABLED_CATEGORIES` | `calendar,contacts,email` | Tool groups to expose |
| `ICLOUD_ENABLED_TOOLS` | `safe-mail` | Exact tool-name allowlist, `safe-mail`, or explicit `all` |
| `ICLOUD_HTML_MODE` | `markdown` | Rich text in event/contact fields: `markdown`, `text` or `raw` |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT`, `PORT`, `MCP_SERVER_HOST`, `MCP_SERVER_PATH` | stdio, `8000`, `0.0.0.0`, `/mcp` | HTTP transport |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging (always to stderr, stdout is reserved for stdio) |

## Troubleshooting

- **"Authentication required"**: no credentials reached the server. Check the `env` block / headers.
- **"iCloud rejected the credentials" / HTTP 401**: wrong app-specific password, or the Apple ID password was used.
- **"IMAP login failed"** but calendar works: the Apple ID has no iCloud Mail address (Apple IDs created with a third-party email cannot use iCloud Mail).
- **Events land at the wrong time**: set `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` or pass `timezone` explicitly.
- **HTTP 401 `unauthorized`** from the server itself: `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set and the request did not carry it.
- **"Refusing to use ... URL on untrusted host"**: an ID was not one returned by the list tools; pass the URL verbatim.
- **Server logs**: everything goes to stderr; in Claude Desktop see Help → Show Logs.
